Way to create new words!


Using TF and RNN found a neat way to generate new words. It's based off how kids will splice sounds with words they know to form new ones. 
The code isn't commented or neat right now, under the weather a bit. But if you're not tech savvy, look at the files and the _short_ .txt files.
Those are quick examples of the new words.
I was inspired to make this because philohsophers love making new words, so I thought I'd throw my hat in the ring.
